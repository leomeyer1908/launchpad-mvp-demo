# LaunchPad MVP – Data Model & Dashboard Spec

This document defines the minimal data model and dashboard UX for the **LaunchPad** MVP demo.

LaunchPad is a small example SaaS app that shows what a founder gets after a **5-day MVP sprint**:
sign up → subscribe → land on a project dashboard with real-looking data.

---

## Data Model: Project

### Entity: `Project`

**Purpose**

Represents a single SaaS “project” owned by a user (founder). Used to show something meaningful on a dashboard
after signup + payment.

Each logged-in user sees **only their own projects**.

### Conceptual Fields

| Field        | Type     | Required? | Example                  | Notes                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | string   | yes       | `proj_cuid123`           | Unique ID, generated by the system                      |
| `userId`     | string   | yes       | `user_cuid456`           | Foreign key → `User.id`                                 |
| `name`       | string   | yes       | `Marketing Site v2`      | Short name shown on cards                               |
| `description`| string   | no        | `Main SaaS app`          | Optional longer description                             |
| `mrr`        | integer  | yes       | `1200`                   | Monthly Recurring Revenue in **USD dollars**            |
| `activeUsers`| integer  | yes       | `85`                     | Count of active users for this project                  |
| `status`     | enum     | yes       | `ACTIVE`                 | High-level status                                       |
| `createdAt`  | datetime | yes       | `2025-02-10T12:00:00Z`   | When project was created                                |
| `updatedAt`  | datetime | yes       | `2025-02-12T09:30:00Z`   | Auto-updated when project changes                       |

### `ProjectStatus` enum (conceptual)

Possible values for `status`:

- `ACTIVE` – live / normal
- `TRIALING` – new project in trial / pre-launch
- `PAUSED` – temporarily on hold
- `CANCELLED` – no longer in use

### Relationships

- **User 1 –– ∞ Project**
  - One `User` can own many `Project` records.
  - Each `Project.userId` references a single `User.id`.

### Useful indexes (for later, if needed)

- Projects by user: index on `userId`
- Default ordering: `createdAt DESC` (newest projects first)

---

## Dashboard Page – UX Plan

We define one main page for this demo:

- **Path:** `/dashboard`
- **Access:** protected; only accessible to **logged-in** users.
- If not authenticated → redirect to `/signin`.

The goal is to give the founder a **quick visual overview** of their projects and revenue right after checkout.

### Layout Sections

Think of the page as four blocks:

1. **Header bar**
2. **Summary metrics row**
3. **Projects list**
4. **“New Project” form**

#### 1. Header bar

- Title: `Dashboard`
- Subtitle: short line, e.g.:

  > `Overview of your projects and revenue.`

- On the right side: a primary button:

  > `New project`

  Clicking this either scrolls to the form section or toggles a small inline form on the same page.

#### 2. Summary metrics row

Display high-level metrics for the logged-in user:

- **Total MRR**
  - Definition: sum of `mrr` for all the user’s `Project` records.
  - Rendered as something like: `$2,100 MRR`.

- **Project count**
  - Definition: number of `Project` records for this user.
  - Rendered as something like: `3 projects`.

- **(Optional) Active projects**
  - Definition: number of projects where `status = ACTIVE`.
  - Rendered as something like: `2 active`.

Notes to implement later (for layout):

> Summary cards in a row:
> - Card 1: “Total MRR (USD)”
> - Card 2: “Projects”
> - Card 3 (optional): “Active projects”

#### 3. Projects list

Layout: **card list** (one card per project) in a responsive grid.

Each **Project card** should show:

- Project name (prominent)
- Short description (truncated if long)
- MRR (e.g. `$1,200 MRR`)
- Active users (e.g. `85 active users`)
- Status as a **colored pill** (`ACTIVE`, `TRIALING`, `PAUSED`, `CANCELLED`)
- Created date (short format), e.g.:

  > `Created Feb 10, 2025`

**Empty state** (no projects yet):

- Show a short message:

  > `You don’t have any projects yet. Create your first one to see this dashboard in action.`

- Include a button:

  > `Create your first project`

  Clicking it scrolls to the form or opens it inline.

#### 4. “New Project” form

Placement: either at the bottom of the page or in a section that opens when “New project” is clicked.

Form fields:

- **Project name** (required, text)
- **Description** (optional, textarea or short text)
- **Monthly MRR (USD)** (number input)
- **Active users** (number input)
- **Status** (select/dropdown)

  - Options: `ACTIVE`, `TRIALING`, `PAUSED`, `CANCELLED`
  - Default: `ACTIVE`

Submit button:

- Label: `Create project`

After successful submit (later implementation details):

- Create a `Project` row in the database linked to the current `User`.
- Recompute summary metrics (Total MRR, Project count, etc.).
- Re-render the project list with the new project at the top.

## Demo Seed Data (for Loom)

For the demo Loom, the dashboard should look “alive” immediately after the user signs in.

### Demo user

- **Demo user email:** `founder@example.com`

(This email will be used when seeding data and when recording the Loom.)

### Seed projects

Seed at least three projects for `founder@example.com`:

1. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - `mrr = 1200`
   - `activeUsers = 85`
   - `status = ACTIVE`

2. **Internal Tools Revamp**
   - `mrr = 600`
   - `activeUsers = 40`
   - `status = TRIALING`

3. **Client Portal (Legacy)**
   - `mrr = 300`
   - `activeUsers = 20`
   - `status = PAUSED`

These records should produce a dashboard that feels realistic:

- Total MRR ≈ `$2,100`
- Project count = `3`
- With a mix of statuses and active user counts.

### Loom walkthrough notes

- Sign in as `founder@example.com`.
- Go straight to `/dashboard`:
  - Show summary metrics (`$2,100 MRR`, `3 projects`).
  - Scroll through the three seeded project cards.
- Optionally:
  - Use the “New Project” form to add a fourth project live in the Loom.
  - Point out that this mirrors what a founder would see after a 5-day MVP sprint.

---

## Summary

This spec defines:

- The `Project` entity and how it relates to `User`.
- The `/dashboard` page layout and behavior.
- The demo seed data to make the Loom walkthrough feel real.

Next steps (implementation, **not** in this doc):

- Add `Project` model to Prisma.
- Run migrations and seed demo data.
- Implement `/dashboard` page UI using this spec.
- Wire up “New Project” creation for the logged-in user.

---

## Navigation & App Flows

This section defines how the user moves between pages and what appears in the header navigation.

### Header Navigation

The header should be simple and focused around getting people into the app and onto the dashboard.

**Logged-out state**

- Visible items:
  - **Logo / Home** → `/`
  - **Subscribe** → `/subscribe`
  - **Sign in** → `/signin`

- Behavior:
  - Clicking **Subscribe** while logged out is allowed (Stripe test mode checkout).
  - After checkout, the user can click a link or nav item to sign in and then visit the dashboard.

**Logged-in state**

- Visible items:
  - **Logo / Home** → `/`
  - **Dashboard** → `/dashboard`
  - **Subscribe** → `/subscribe` (kept for demo; in a real app might change to “Upgrade plan” / “Change plan”)
  - **Sign out** button or link

- Behavior:
  - Clicking **Dashboard** always goes to `/dashboard`.
  - Clicking **Subscribe** while logged in uses the current user’s email as the Stripe checkout customer email.
  - After signing out, the user is returned to the logged-out nav state.

> For the Loom, you’ll typically:
> 1) Sign in, 2) Show `/dashboard`, 3) Optionally show `/subscribe` and `/billing` (if needed), then 4) Sign out.

---

## Dashboard Greeting & Sections Summary

The dashboard should feel like a “home” view for the logged-in founder.

### Greeting

At the top of `/dashboard`, show a small greeting that uses the logged-in user’s email:

- Example text:

  - Line 1 (title): `Dashboard`
  - Line 2 (subtitle): `Signed in as founder@example.com` (replace with actual user email)

You can optionally include a friendlier line such as:

> `Welcome back! Here’s a snapshot of your projects and revenue.`

### Sections on `/dashboard`

The page should contain these sections, in order:

1. **Greeting area / header bar**
   - Title: `Dashboard`
   - Subtitle: “Signed in as [user email]”
   - Primary button on the right: `New project` (opens or scrolls to the form).

2. **Summary metrics row**
   - Card 1: **Total MRR (USD)** – sum of `mrr` for all projects for this user.
   - Card 2: **Projects** – number of `Project` records for this user.
   - Card 3 (optional): **Active projects** – number of projects where `status = ACTIVE`.

3. **“Your Projects” list**
   - Section title: `Your Projects`
   - If there are projects:
     - Render as cards in a grid or single column:
       - Project name (heading)
       - Short description
       - `$X,XXX MRR`
       - `N active users`
       - Status pill (`ACTIVE`, `TRIALING`, etc.)
       - Created date (e.g., `Created Feb 10, 2025`)
   - If there are **no** projects:
     - Show an empty state message:

       > `You don’t have any projects yet. Create your first one to see this dashboard in action.`

     - Below it, a button: `Create your first project` that scrolls to or opens the New Project form.

4. **“New Project” form**
   - Section title: `New Project`
   - Fields:
     - Project name (required)
     - Description (optional)
     - Monthly MRR (USD) – number input
     - Active users – number input
     - Status – dropdown: `ACTIVE`, `TRIALING`, `PAUSED`, `CANCELLED` (default: `ACTIVE`)
   - Submit button: `Create project`
   - After submit: user stays on `/dashboard`, the summary metrics and project list refresh to include the new project.

---

## Core Flows (for the demo)

These are the flows you’ll likely show in your Loom:

1. **First-time visit (logged out)**
   - User lands on `/`.
   - Clicks **Sign in** → goes to `/signin`, signs in with magic link.

2. **Dashboard view (logged in)**
   - After sign in, user clicks **Dashboard** in the header.
   - Sees greeting (`Signed in as ...`), summary metrics, and the seeded projects.

3. **Create a new project**
   - On `/dashboard`, user clicks **New project**.
   - Fills out the form and submits.
   - A new project appears at the top of the list; summary metrics update.

4. **Subscribe (optional in Loom)**
   - From header, click **Subscribe**.
   - Stripe checkout opens with the logged-in email pre-filled.
   - After payment, user returns and can still access `/dashboard`.

These flows are enough context to guide the implementation and to narrate a clear Loom walkthrough.

## README Positioning & Structure

Goal: when someone lands on the repo, they immediately understand that this is a **demo SaaS MVP starter** that you can deliver in a week.

The actual `README.md` will eventually be updated to follow this structure.

### 1. Title & One-Line Description

**Repo name (suggested):**

- `LaunchPad – SaaS MVP Starter Demo`

**Top tagline (one line):**

> `LaunchPad: example SaaS MVP starter with email auth, Stripe subscription, and a simple project dashboard.`

Optionally add a short follow-up sentence:

> `Built to show what a founder gets from a 5-day MVP sprint: sign up, subscribe, see a real dashboard, and manage billing.`

### 2. Stack Section

Add a short **“Stack”** section with bullet points like:

- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Prisma + Supabase Postgres
- Auth.js (magic-link email sign-in)
- Stripe Checkout + Billing Portal
- PostHog (analytics events)
- Deployed on Vercel (for demo)

This makes it immediately clear to technical founders/CTOs what they’re looking at.

### 3. Quickstart / Setup Instructions

Reuse and adapt the Quickstart from the original boilerplate README (install deps, env vars, Prisma migrate, dev server).

Target subsections:

1. **Clone & install**

   - `npm install`

2. **Environment**

   - Copy `.env.example` → `.env`
   - Fill in Supabase, Resend, Stripe, PostHog keys (same as boilerplate).
   - Optionally mention that the demo uses `founder@example.com` as the seeded user.

3. **Database**

   - `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - (Later, when the seed script exists) `npm run seed` or `node prisma/seed.ts` to create `founder@example.com` and demo projects.

4. **Run dev server**

   - `npm run dev`
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`

You don’t need to write the exact commands here; just note that the Quickstart section will closely mirror the boilerplate setup with a small “demo user” note added.

### 4. “What This Demo Includes” Section

Add a section like:

> `## What this demo includes`

Bullets to cover:

- Email magic-link sign-in via Auth.js.
- Stripe subscription checkout for a single plan (test mode).
- Redirect to `/success` on successful checkout and `/cancelled` if abandoned.
- Protected `/dashboard` page:
  - Greeting with signed-in email.
  - Summary metrics (Total MRR, project count, optional active projects).
  - “Your Projects” list with seeded example projects.
  - “New Project” form to add a new project.
- Stripe Billing Portal link from the protected area for managing subscription.

This mirrors the flows you’ll show in your Loom: **sign in → subscribe → dashboard → manage billing.**

### 5. “How This Maps to Real MVPs” Section

Add a section like:

> `## How this maps to real MVPs`

Use short bullets to explain how you’d customize this for a real client:

- Swap the `Project` model for the client’s core entities (e.g., bookings, customers, properties, campaigns).
- Customize pricing and Stripe products (multiple tiers, annual plans, trial periods).
- Add more views to the dashboard (filters, charts, per-project drill-down).
- Integrate the client’s preferred tools (CRM, email provider, analytics stack).
- Layer in role-based access (admin vs. member), teams/workspaces if needed.
- Iterate through 1–2 weekly sprints to add features once the MVP skeleton is live.

This section makes it obvious that:

- This demo is a **starting point**, not a toy.
- You already have a mental model for turning it into a paid engagement.

### 6. “Who This Is For” (Optional but Helpful)

Optional small section:

> `## Who this is for`

Bullets such as:

- Indie SaaS founders who need something demo-ready in under a week.
- Small teams that want to validate billing + core UI before investing in a full build.
- Agencies that need a solid technical base for client MVPs.

This ties directly back to your **MVP Jumpstart** offer and gives context when you link the repo from your Notion/offer menu.

---

**Note:** This section is a planning guide. The actual `README.md` can be updated after the dashboard and seeding are implemented so the description perfectly matches what the app does.
